======= Introduction =======

A theoretical understanding of the behavior of many-body systems
is a  great challenge and provides fundamental insights into quantum 
mechanical studies, as well
as offering potential areas of applications.
However, apart from some few analytically solvable problems,
the typical absence of an exactly solvable contribution to the
many-particle
 Hamiltonian
means that we need reliable numerical many-body methods.
These methods should allow for controlled approximations
and provide a computational scheme which accounts for successive
many-body corrections in a systematic way.
Typical examples of
popular many-body methods are coupled-cluster methods
cite{bartlett81,helgaker,Dean2004},
various types of
Monte Carlo methods cite{Pudliner1997,kdl97,ceperley1995},
perturbative expansions cite{lindgren,mhj95},
Green's function methods cite{dickhoff,blaizot},
the density-matrix renormalization group cite{white1992,schollwock2005},
ab initio density functional theory
cite{bartlett2005,peirs2003,vanneck2006}
and large-scale diagonalization methods
cite{Whitehead1977,caurier2005,navratil2004,horoi2006}. 

However, all these methods have to face in some form or the other the problem of 
an exponential growth in dimensionality. For a system of $P$ fermions
which 
can be placed 
into $N$ levels, the total number of basis states are given by
$\left(\begin{array}{c}N\\P\end{array}\right)$.
The dimensional curse means that most quantum
mechanical calculations on classical computers have exponential
complexity and therefore are very hard to solve for larger systems. On 
the other hand, a so-called 
quantum computer, a particularly dedicated computer,
can improve greatly on the size of systems that can be simulated, as
foreseen by Feynman cite{feynman1982,feynman1986}. A quantum computer 
does not need
an exponential amount of memory to represent a quantum state.  
The basic unit of information for a  quantum computer 
is the so-called qubit or quantum bit. Any
suitable 
two-level quantum system can be a qubit, but the  
standard model of quantum computation is a model where two-level
quantum systems are located at different points in
space, and are manipulated by a small universal set of  operations.
These operations are called gates in the same fashion as operations on
bits in classical computers are called gates. 

For the example of $P$ spin $1/2$  particles, 
a classical computer needs $2^P$ bits to represent all possible states, while  
a quantum computer needs only $P$ qubits. The complexity in
number of qubits is thus linear.  Based on these ideas, several groups have proposed
various algorithms for simulating quantal many-body systems on quantum computers.
Abrams 
and  Lloyd, see for example Refs. cite{lloyd1997,lloyd1999a}, introduced a  
quantum algorithm that uses the quantum fast Fourier transform to find 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a given Hamiltonian,
illustrating how one could solve classically intractable problems with  
less than 100 qubits.
Achieving a polynomial complexity in the number of operations needed
to simulate a quantum system is not that straightforward however.
To get efficient simulations in time one
needs to transform the  many-body Hamiltonian into a sum of operations
on qubits, the building blocks of the quantum simulator and computer,
so that the time evolution operator can be implemented in polynomial
time. 
In Refs. cite{somma2002,somma2005,ortiz2002} it was shown how the
Jordan-Wigner 
transformation in principle
does this for all Hamiltonians acting on fermionic many-body states.
Based on this approach, recently two groups, see Refs. cite{krbrown2006,yang2006}, published 
results where 
they used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) qubits to simulate the
pairing Hamiltonian.  


The aim of this work is to develop an algorithm than allows one to perform   
a quantum computer simulation (or simply quantum simulation hereafter) of  any many-body
fermionic Hamiltonian. We show how to generate, via various Jordan-Wigner
transformations, all qubit operations
needed to simulate the time evolution operator of a given  Hamiltonian.
We also show that for a given term in an $m$-body fermionic
Hamiltonian, the number of operations needed to simulate it is linear
in the number of qubits or energy-levels of the system. The number of
terms in the Hamiltonian is of the order of $m^2$ for a
general $m$-body interaction, making the simulation increasingly
harder with higher order interactions. We specialize our examples to a two-body Hamiltonian,
since this is also the most general  type of Hamiltonian encountered in many-body physics.
Besides fields like nuclear physics, where three-body forces play a non-neglible role,
a two-body Hamiltonian captures most of the relevant physics. The various transformations are
detailed in the next section. In Section ref{sec:details} 
we show in detail how to simulate a quantum computer finding the
eigenvalues of any two-body Hamiltonian, with all available particle
numbers, 
using the simulated time
#  til mhj fra eirik
evolution operator. In that section we describe also the techniques which are necessary for the
extraction of information using a phase-estimation algorithm. 

To demonstrate the feasibility of our algorithm, 
we present in Section ref{sec:results} selected results from applications of 
our algorithm to two simple model-Hamiltonians, a pairing Hamiltonian and the Hubbard model.
We summarize our results and present future perspectives in  
Section ref{sec:conclusion}.


======= Algorithm for quantum computations of fermionic systems =======
label{sec:algo}
===== Hamiltonians =====

A general two-body Hamiltonian for fermionic system 
can be written as

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:twobodyH}
H = E_0 + \sum_{ij=1} E_{ij} a^\dag_i a_j
+\sum_{ijkl = 1} V_{ijkl} a^\dag_i a^\dag_j a_l a_k,
\end{equation}
!et 
where $E_0$ is a constant energy term, $E_{ij}$ represent all the
one-particle terms, allowing for non-diagonal terms as well. The
one-body term can represent 
a chosen single-particle potential, the kinetic energy or other more
specialized terms such as  
those discussed in connection with the Hubbard model
cite{hubbardmodel} or the pairing Hamiltonian  
discussed below.
The two-body interaction part is given by $V_{ijkl}$ and can be any
two-body interaction, from 
Coulomb interaction to the interaction between nucleons.  
The sums run over all possible single-particle levels $N$. 
Note that
this model includes particle numbers from zero to the number of
available quantum levels, $n$. To simulate states with fixed numbers
of fermions one would have to either rewrite the Hamiltonian or
generate specialized input states in the simulation.
# Hereafter we let $n$ represent the number of fermions, while $N$
# represents the number of qubits. 

The algorithm which we will develop in this section and in
Section ref{sec:details} can treat any 
two-body Hamiltonian. However, 
in our demonstrations of the quantum computing algorithm, we will limit ourselves to
two simple models, which however capture much of the important physics
in quantum mechanical 
many-body systems. We will also limit ourselves to spin $j=1/2$
systems, although our algorithm 
can also simulate  higher $j$-values, such as those which occur in nuclear, atomic and
molecular physics, it simply uses one qubit for every available
quantum state.   
These simple models are the Hubbard model and a pairing
Hamiltonian.
We start with the spin $1/2$ Hubbard model, described by the following Hamiltonian

!bt

!bt
\begin{align}
H_H &&= \epsilon \sum_{i, \sigma} a_{i\sigma}^\dag a_{i\sigma} 
-t \sum_{i, \sigma} \left(a^\dag_{i+1, \sigma}a_{i, \sigma}
+a^\dag_{i, \sigma}a_{i+1, \sigma} \right) \notag \\
&& + U \sum_{i=1} a_{i+}^\dag a_{i-}^\dag a_{i-}a_{i+},
label{eq:hubbard}
\end{align}
!et
!et
where $a^{\dagger}$ and $a$ are fermion creation and annihilation operators, respectively.
This is a chain of sites where each site has room for one spin up
fermion and one spin down fermion. 
The number of sites is $N$, and the sums over $\sigma$ are sums over
spin up and down only.
Each site has a single-particle
energy $\epsilon$. There is a repulsive term $U$ if there is a pair
of particles at the same site. It is energetically favourable to tunnel to
neighbouring sites, described by 
the hopping terms with coupling constant $-t$.

The second model-Hamiltonian is the simple pairing Hamiltonian

!bt
\begin{equation}
   H_P=\sum_i \varepsilon_i a^{\dagger}_i a_i -\frac{1}{2} g\sum_{ij>0}
           a^{\dagger}_{i}
     a^{\dagger}_{\bar{\imath}}a_{\bar{\jmath}}a_{j},
     label{eq:pairing}
\end{equation}
!et
 The indices $i$ and $j$ run over the number of levels $N$, and the label $\bar{\imath}$ 
stands for a time-reversed state. The parameter $g$ is the strength of the pairing force 
while $\varepsilon_i$ is the single-particle energy of level $i$. 
In our case
we assume that the single-particle levels are equidistant (or
degenerate) with a fixed spacing $d$. 
Moreover, in our simple model, the degeneracy of the single-particle
levels is set to $2j+1=2$, with $j=1/2$  
being the spin of the particle. This gives a set of single-particle
states with the same spin projections as 
for the Hubbard model.  Whereas in the Hubbard model we operate with
different sites with  
spin up or spin down particles, our pairing models deals thus with
levels  with double degeneracy. 
Introducing the pair-creation operator 
$S^+_i=a^{\dagger}_{im}a^{\dagger}_{i-m}$,
one can rewrite the Hamiltonian in 
Eq.\ (ref{eq:pairing}) as

!bt
\begin{equation*}
   H_P=d\sum_iiN_i+
     \frac{1}{2} G\sum_{ij>0}S^+_iS^-_j,
\end{equation*}
!et
where  $N_i=a^{\dagger}_i a_i$
is the number operator, and 
$\varepsilon_i = id$ so that the single-particle orbitals 
are equally spaced at intervals $d$. The latter commutes with the 
Hamiltonian $H$. In this model, quantum numbers like seniority 
$\cal{S}$ are good quantum numbers, and the eigenvalue problem 
can be rewritten in terms of blocks with good seniority. 
Loosely 
speaking, the seniority quantum number $\cal{S}$ is equal to 
the number of unpaired particles; see  cite{Talmi1993} for 
further details. 
Furthermore, in  a series of papers, Richardson, see for example 
Refs. cite{richardson1,richardson2,richardson3},  
obtained the exact solution of the pairing Hamiltonian, with 
semi-analytic (since there is still the need for a numerical solution) 
expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The exact solutions
have had important consequences for several fields, from Bose condensates to
nuclear superconductivity and is currently a very active field of studies, see for example
Refs. cite{dukelsky2004,rmp75mhj}.
Finally, for particle numbers up to $P \sim 20$, the above model can be 
solved exactly through numerical diagonalization and one can obtain all eigenvalues.
It serves therefore also as an excellent ground for comparison with our algorithm based
on models from quantum computing.


===== Basic quantum  gates =====

Benioff showed that one could make a quantum mechanical Turing machine
by using various  unitary operations on a quantum system, see Ref. cite{benioff}.
Benioff  demonstrated 
that a quantum computer can calculate anything a
classical computer can. To do this one needs a quantum system and
basic operations that can approximate all unitary operations
on the chosen many-body system. We describe in this subsection the basic ingredients entering 
our algorithms.

=== Qubits, gates and circuits ===
label{sec:gates}
In this article we will use the standard model of quantum information,
where
the basic unit of information is the qubit, the quantum bit. 
As mentioned in the introduction, any
suitable 
two-level quantum system can be a qubit, 
it is the smallest system there is with the
least complex dynamics.
Qubits are both abstract measures of information and physical objects.
Actual physical qubits can be ions trapped in magnetic fields where
lasers can access only two energy levels or  the nuclear spins of some of
the atoms in molecules accessed and manipulated by an NMR machine.
Several other ideas have been proposed and some tested, see
cite{nielsen2000}. 

The computational basis for one qubit is ${\ensuremath{|0\rangle}}$ (representing for example bit $0$) 
for the first state
and ${\ensuremath{|1\rangle}}$ (representing bit $1$) for the second, and for a set of qubits  
the tensor products of
these basis states for each qubit form a product basis. Below we write out the different
basis states for a system of $n$ qubits.

!bt

!bt
\begin{align}
label{eq:compBasis}
&{\ensuremath{|0\rangle}} \equiv {\ensuremath{|00\cdots 0\rangle}} =
      {\ensuremath{|0\rangle}} \otimes {\ensuremath{| 0\rangle}} \otimes
          \cdots 
\otimes {\ensuremath{|0\rangle}} 
\notag \\
&{\ensuremath{|1\rangle}} \equiv {\ensuremath{|00\cdots 1\rangle}} =
    {\ensuremath{|0\rangle}} \otimes {\ensuremath{| 0\rangle}} \otimes
        \cdots 
\otimes {\ensuremath{|1\rangle}} 
\notag \\
&\vdots \notag \\
&{\ensuremath{|2^n-1\rangle}} \equiv {\ensuremath{|11\cdots 1\rangle}} =
    {\ensuremath{|1\rangle}} \otimes {\ensuremath{| 1\rangle}} \otimes 
\cdots \otimes {\ensuremath{|1 \rangle}}.
\notag \\
\end{align}
!et
!et
This is a $2^n$-dimensional system and we number the different basis
states using binary numbers corresponding to the order in which they appear in the
tensor product.

Quantum computing means to  manipulate and measure  qubits in such a
way that the results from a measurement yield the solutions to  a given problem. 
The quantum operations we need to be able to perform our simulations are 
a small set of elementary single-qubit
operations, or single-qubit gates, and one universal two-qubit gate,
in our case the so-called CNOT gate defined below.

To represent quantum computer algorithms graphically we use circuit
diagrams. In a circuit diagram each qubit is represented by a line,
and operations on the different qubits are represented by boxes.
In fig. ref{fig:circ} we show an example of a quantum circuit, with the arrow 
indicating the time evolution,
FIGURE: [fig6.eps}
	}
	\caption{Resulting probability
          distribution from the simulated measurements, width=400] The eigenvalues           of the non-degenerate pairing model with four energy levels with a total           possibility of 8  particles, the level spacing $d$ is $0.5$           and the  pairing strength $g$ is $1$.            The correct eigenvalues are obtained from exact           diagonalization, but in this case there is a multitude of           eigenvalues and only some eigenvalues are found from this           first simulation.         } 	 \end{center label{fig:P24-17-e3IMd}

===== Number of work qubits versus number of simulation qubits =====

The largest possible amount of different eigenvalues is $2^s$, where
$s$ is the number of simulation qubits. The resolution in the energy
spectrum we get from measuring upon the work qubits is $2^w$, with $w$ the number of
work qubits.
Therefore the resolution per eigenvalue in a non-degenerate system is
$2^{w-s}$. The higher the degeneracy the less work qubits are needed. 


In Figure ref{fig:24-17-1T0} we see the results for the Hubbard model
Eq. (ref{eq:hubbard})
with $\epsilon=1$, $t=0$ and $U=1$. The reason we chose $t=0$ was just
because of the higher degeneracy and therefore fewer eigenvalues.
 The number of work qubits is $16$
and the number of simulation qubits is eight for a total of $24$
qubits. The difference between work qubits and simulation qubits is
eight which means there are $2^8$ possible energy values for each
eigenvalue. Combining that with the high degeneracy we get a very sharp
resolution. The correct eigenvalues with degeneracies are obtained from exact
diagonalization of  the Hamiltonian, the degeneracy follows the
eigenvalue in paranthesis: 0(1), 1(8), 2(24), 3(36), 4(40), 5(48), 6(38),
7(24), 8(24), 9(4), 10(8), 12(1). We can clearly see that even though
we have a random input state, with a random superposition of the
eigenvectors, there is a correspondence between the height of the
peaks in the plot and the degeneracy of the eigenvalues they represent.

===== Number of operations =====

Counting the number of single-qubit and $\sigma_z\sigma_z$ operations
for different sizes of systems simulated gives us an indication of the
decoherence time needed for different physical realizations of a
quantum simulator or computer. The decoherence time is an average time
in which the state of the qubits will be destroyed by noise, also called 
decoherence, while the operation time is the average time an operation takes
to perform on the given system. Their fraction is the number of
operations possible to perform before decoherence destroys the
computation. In table ref{fig:noOfGates} we have listed the number of
gates used for the pairing model, $H_P$, and the Hubbard model, $H_H$,
for different number of simulation qubits.

======= Conclusion =======
label{sec:conclusion}

In this article we have shown explicitly how the Jordan-Wigner
transformation is used to simulate any many-body fermionic Hamiltonian
by two-qubit operations. We have shown how the simulation of such
Hamiltonian terms of products of creation and annihilation operators
are represented by a number of operations linear in the number of
qubits. 
To perform efficient quantum simulations on quantum computers one
needs transformations that take the Hamiltonian in question to a set
of operations on the qubits simulating the physical system. An example of 
such a transformation employed in ths work, is 
the Jordan-Wigner transformation.  With the appropriate transformation and
relevant gates or quantum circuits, one can taylor  an actual quantum computer to
simulate and solve the eigenvalue and eigenvector problems for different quantum systems. 
Specialized quantum simulators might be more efficient in solving some
problems than others because of similarities in algebras between physical system
of qubits and the physical system simulated. 

We have limited the applications to two simple and well-studied models that provide,
via exact eigenvalues, a good testing ground for our quantum computing based 
algorithm.  For both the pairing model and the Hubbard model we obtain an excellent agreement.
We plan to extend the area of application to quantum mechanical studies  of systems in nuclear physics,
such as a comparison of shell-model studies of oxygen or calcium isotopes where the nucleons are active 
in a given number of single-particle orbits cite{mhj95,caurier2005}. These single-particle orbits have normally a higher 
degeneracy than $2$, a degeneracy  studied here.  However, the algorithm we have developed allows
for the inclusion of any  degeneracy, meaning in turn that with a given interaction $V_{ijkl}$   
and single-particle energies, we can compare the nuclear shell-model (configuration interaction) calculations
with our algorithm.

======= Useful relations =======

We list here some useful relations involving different $\sigma$ matrices,

!bt
\begin{equation}
\sigma_x \sigma_z = -i\sigma_y, \quad
\sigma_z \sigma_x = i\sigma_y, \quad [\sigma_x, \sigma_z]=-2i\sigma_y,
\end{equation}
!et

!bt
\begin{equation}
\sigma_x \sigma_y = i\sigma_z, \quad
\sigma_y \sigma_x = -i\sigma_z, \quad [\sigma_x, \sigma_y]=2i\sigma_z,
\end{equation}
!et
and

!bt
\begin{equation}
\sigma_y \sigma_z = i\sigma_x, \quad
\sigma_z \sigma_y = -i\sigma_x, \quad [\sigma_y, \sigma_z]=2i\sigma_x.
\end{equation}
!et


For any two non-equal $\sigma$-matrices $a$ and $b$ we have

!bt
\begin{equation}
aba = -b.
\end{equation}
!et

The Hermitian $\sigma$-matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$ and $\sigma_z$
result in the identity matrix when squared

!bt
\begin{equation}
\sigma_x^2 = _1_,\quad 
\sigma_y^2 = _1_,\quad 
\sigma_z^2 = _1_,\quad 
\end{equation}
!et
which can be used to obtain  simplified expressions for exponential functions involving $\sigma$-matrices

!bt
\begin{equation}
e^{\pm i\alpha \sigma}=\cos(\alpha) _1_ \pm i \sin(\alpha) \sigma. 
\end{equation}
!et

The equations we list below are necessary for the relation between  a general unitary
transformation on a set of qubits with  a product of two-qubit unitary
transformations. We have the general equation for $a,b \in \{\sigma_x,\sigma_y, \sigma_z\}$, where $a\neq b$.

!bt

!bt
\begin{align}
  e^{-i\pi/4a} b e^{i\pi/4a} &&= \frac{1}{2} (_1_ -ia) b ( _1_ + ia)
  \notag\\ 
  &&=  \frac{1}{2} (b + aba + i[b,a]) \notag\\
  &&= \frac{i}{2}[b,a].
\end{align}
!et
!et
The more specialized equations read

!bt

!bt
\begin{align}
  label{eq:rotations1}
  &&e^{-i\pi/4 \sigma_x} \sigma_z e^{i\pi/4 \sigma_x} = -\sigma_y, \\
  label{eq:rotations2}
  &&e^{-i\pi/4 \sigma_y} \sigma_z e^{i\pi/4 \sigma_y} = \sigma_x, \\
  label{eq:rotations3}
  &&e^{-i\pi/4 \sigma_z} \sigma_x e^{i\pi/4 \sigma_z} = \sigma_y, \\
  label{eq:rotations4}
  &&e^{-i\pi/4 \sigma_z} \sigma_y e^{i\pi/4 \sigma_z} = -\sigma_x. 
\end{align}
!et
!et

We need also different products of the operator$\sigma_z$  with the  raising and lowering operators

!bt

!bt
\begin{align}
label{eq:pmzs}
  &&\sigma_+ \sigma_z = -\sigma_+ \\
  &&\sigma_z \sigma_+ = \sigma_+, \\
  &&\sigma_- \sigma_z = \sigma_-, \\
  &&\sigma_z \sigma_- = -\sigma_-. \\
\end{align}
